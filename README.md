# Dotfiles

I've created this using a git bare repo in my home directory

I'll be constantly adding and updating my dotfiles according to the changes I make on my config files

Mostly for my own version control, but feel free to have a look and yank some code. But this is a personalized setup that fits my preferences when developing software.

Currently:
- Tmux
- Sketchybar
- Nvim
- Yabai
- Skdb
